The flow chart, Fig. S1, shows how to drive a self-consistent solution for TDKS equation. *[Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/)* performs the step (A) (B) (C) (H) (I) (K). Itâ€™s generally required for constructing $$\mathcal{H_k}(t_2)$$ to guess an initial guess of $$\rho^{in} (\mathbf{G},t_2 )$$ before TD evolution. The new charge density $$\rho^{new} (\mathbf{G},t_2 )$$ can be calculated by the Eqs (10)-(19). The self-consistent calculation will stop until  $$\rho^{new} (\mathbf{G},t_2 )$$ is consistent with $$\rho^{in} (\mathbf{G},t_2 )$$.
